## üìö Historical Context

### Priority 2 Features (Completed July 2025)
The Priority 2 features were successfully implemented and tested:

1. **Neural Network Stereo Matching** - TensorRT/ONNX backends with adaptive optimization
2. **Multi-Camera Support** - Synchronized capture and real-time processing
3. **Professional Installers** - Cross-platform packaging framework
4. **Enhanced Performance Benchmarking** - Comprehensive testing with reports

**Performance Results:**
- Neural Networks: 274 FPS (StereoNet), 268 FPS (PSMNet)
- Multi-Camera: 473 FPS (2 cameras), 236 FPS (4 cameras)
- Complete test validation with generated reports

### Documentation Evolution
The project documentation evolved from scattered milestone files to an organized structure:

**Before:** 21+ documentation files in root directory
**After:** Organized structure with:
- `documentation/` - User and developer guides
- `docs/` - Technical documentation
- `archive/milestone_docs/` - Historical milestones

## üîç Using Archived Content

### Accessing Test Programs
If you need to run the Priority 2 test programs:

```bash
cd archive/temp_tests

# Neural network tests
./test_neural_network

# Multi-camera tests  
./test_multicamera

# Benchmarking tests
./test_benchmarking

# Priority 2 summary
./priority2_summary
```

### Reviewing Historical Documentation
For understanding project evolution:

```bash
# View completion summaries
cat archive/milestone_docs/PRIORITY2_COMPLETE.md
cat archive/milestone_docs/FINAL_SUCCESS.md

# Review feature implementations
cat archive/milestone_docs/ADVANCED_FEATURES_COMPLETE.md
cat archive/milestone_docs/CAMERA_FIXES_COMPLETE.md
```

### Performance Reports
Historical benchmark data is available in:
- `reports/benchmarks/` - Current structured reports
- Archive test programs can regenerate performance data

## üöÄ Current Development

For current development, use the modern project structure:

- **Tests**: Use `tests/` and `test_programs/` directories
- **Documentation**: Refer to `documentation/` and `docs/`
- **Build**: Use `./run.sh` with modern build options
- **Reports**: Check `reports/benchmarks/` for current data

## üìù Maintenance

### When to Archive
Files are moved to archive when:
- Feature development is complete
- Documentation becomes historical
- Files clutter the root directory
- Modern equivalents exist

### Archive Policy
- **Keep**: Important historical context and achievements
- **Document**: Clear explanation of what was moved and why
- **Reference**: Maintain links to archived content where relevant
- **Access**: Ensure archived content remains accessible
