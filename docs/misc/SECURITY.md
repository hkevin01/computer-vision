## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: security@project.com

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
3. Audit code to find similar problems
4. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
5. Release security updates as soon as possible

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Review configuration settings
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all input data from untrusted sources
4. **Network Security**: Use secure connections when possible
5. **Access Control**: Limit access to necessary users only

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
2. **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools in CI/CD
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability scans
4. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in test suites

## Known Security Considerations

### Image Processing
- **Malformed Images**: Validate image headers and dimensions
- **Memory Usage**: Prevent excessive memory allocation from large images
- **Buffer Overflows**: Use bounds checking for image operations

### Camera Access
- **Privacy**: Respect user privacy when accessing cameras
- **Permissions**: Request minimal necessary permissions
- **Data Handling**: Secure handling of captured image data

### GPU Computing
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent GPU memory exhaustion
- **Driver Issues**: Handle GPU driver vulnerabilities
- **Compute Validation**: Validate GPU computation results

### Network Features (if applicable)
- **Data Transmission**: Use encryption for sensitive data
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- **Input Validation**: Validate all network inputs
