**C++ is optimal for this project because:**
- **Performance**: Real-time stereo vision and point cloud processing require high performance
- **CUDA integration**: Excellent CUDA support with native C++ bindings
- **OpenCV**: Best performance with C++ API
- **PCL (Point Cloud Library)**: Native C++ library, industry standard for point clouds
- **Memory management**: Direct control over memory allocation/deallocation
- **Hardware integration**: Better camera driver support

Let me explore the current workspace and create a comprehensive C++ computer vision project structure: Perfect! Let me create the complete project structure for a C++ computer vision project. I'll start by creating all the necessary directories and files:
