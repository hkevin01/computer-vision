# Repository Move Map

This file lists files moved during the repository reorganization and their new locations.

Old path -> New path

- DOCKER_SETUP.md -> docs/setup/docker-setup.md
- DOCKER_README.md -> docs/setup/docker-readme.md
- AI_ML_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md -> docs/planning/AI_ML_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md -> docs/architectural/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- IMPROVEMENTS_ROADMAP.md -> docs/planning/IMPROVEMENTS_ROADMAP.md
- README_CLEANUP.md -> docs/guides/README_CLEANUP.md

Scripts reorganized:

- scripts/legacy/* -> subdivided into scripts/docker/, scripts/reorg/, scripts/debug/, with symlinks left in scripts/legacy/ for compatibility.

If you cannot find a file, try searching the `docs/` and `scripts/` directories.
